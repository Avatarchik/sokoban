\subsection{Detailed Description}
Dijkstra algorithm used to see what goals a box can reach and with how many pushes it could. 

This is a special representation of dijkstra because we want to keep possible positions of the pusher after each push. Each box position is represented by 4 nodes : left, up, right and down. Value in each node means \char`\"{}I can push this box in there by pushing it from left/up/right/down with a total of VALUE pushes\char`\"{} 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{CompactItemize}
