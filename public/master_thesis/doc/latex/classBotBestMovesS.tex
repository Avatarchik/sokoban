\section{BotBestMovesS Class Reference}
\label{classBotBestMovesS}\index{BotBestMovesS@{BotBestMovesS}}
A$\ast$ algorithm based on moves number of the pusher. Nodes with less moves are explored first. WARNING : this algorithm doesn't return best moves solution of this level but only a good solution. This is because a state representation of the level doesn't keep exact pusher position but only a pusher zone. This solver will work efficiently (but with a lot of extra work) only if we make level representation with boxes position (zone) and exact pusher position (integer).

Cost function to evaluate the cost of a treenode with its position in the tree (parent of treenode must be assigned before calling this function) this cost function will compute number of moves from the start until this node. So we can search min moves number first WARNING : not finished yet, to be really efficient, h(x) must be definied \index{BotBestMovesS@{BotBestMovesS}!h@{h}}
